### Athletic Performance Prediction using Machine Learning/AI

This project was developed as part of my master's thesis, where I explored the use of Machine Learning and AI to predict athletic performance metrics. The primary objective was to estimate W'—a measure of power output over time—without requiring exhaustive exercise tests.

Currently, calculating W' requires athletes to undergo a 15-minute exercise test to exhaustion. This test determines both the athlete's critical power threshold and their energy reserve. For instance, a marathon runner typically has a smaller energy reserve than a weightlifter, but they operate below their threshold for longer periods, enabling sustained activity. In theory, if an athlete remains below their W' threshold, they could sustain activity indefinitely.

My work aims to predict this critical power threshold and energy reserve in a much shorter amount of time—potentially from only 30 seconds of exercise data. This approach could revolutionize performance tracking by providing near real-time metrics, especially for endurance sports like cycling. With accurate, rapid estimates of energy reserves, teams could optimize race strategies, particularly in disciplines with sprint sections or variable intensity segments.
